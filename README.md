# StoneworkRoseCafe
A Terraria mod that adds a nice coffee shop. Works with Game Club Modpack

New NPC
-------
The Cafe Owner, who goes by many names, is not only the proprieter of Stonework Cafe, but also an archer, falconer, and avid coffee-drinker. While being particular about the cafe, they allow you to gain a steady income.

18 Collectable Mugs
-------------------
Need to spruce up the cafe? You can now collect 18 coffee mugs, each unique and pose new challenges in acquiring.

Owl Pet
-------
Purchasable from the Cafe Owner, you can have an owl follow you on your adventures!

New Furniture
-------------
The cafe didn't get it's reputation from nowhere. Make new Stone Rose furniture to increase sales in the cafe

Money
-----
The cafe owner knows the real estate isn't cheap. So, completely bypassing the tax collector, you can earn a lot of money from helping make the cafe a noteworthy place to visit in royalties.
